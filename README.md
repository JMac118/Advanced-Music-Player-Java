# Advanced-Music-Player-Java

This is a music player application project that is the final assessment for a unit.
As it needs to demonstrate various software funcionality, some aspects of it are inefficient.

Requirements:
Has dynamic data structures - Uses linked lists
Has hashing techniques - This one is a bit strange for a music player requirement so I just 
added a login page that hashes passwords.
Has sorting algorithm - I printed the linked lists to an array then used a binary search algorithm. This
could have been done in a different way but it meets the assessment requirements.
Uses third party library - The application uses a CSV library to save and load song playlists.
Has GUI - It uses JavaFX to implement a UI

It meets all the requirements but some of those requirements are redundant for a music player.
